### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2022

+ Projec title: The history of Philosophy - from the view of data science
+ This project is conducted by Lichun He.

+ Project summary: The dataset used in this project contains over 360,000 sentences from over 50 texts spanning 13 major schools of the history of philosophy. The represented schools are Plato, Aristotle, Empiricism, Rationalism, Analytic, Continental, Phenomenology, German Idealism, Communism, Capitalism, Stoicism, Nietzsche, and Feminism. Besides, there are 36 represented authors from each school, such as Epictetus from Stoicism or Marx from Communism. After doing data exploration, I divided the period over 2300 years into three stages: (1) the first stage from 350 BC to 125 AD; (2) the second stage from 125 AD to 1637 AD; (3) the third stage from 1637 AD to 1985 AD. After that, I did sentiment analysis, wordcloud, and other data visualization to take a closer look at the data. Then combining my background history knowledge and views supported by several research papers, I write my conclusion of how the data reflect information about the history of philosophy.
